Hello, nice to meet you!

I'm a biologist and mathematician currently enrolled in the M.Sc. program in Neotropical Biodiversity (Ecology) at the Federal University of Latin-american Integration in Brazil. I'm mostly interested in all aspects of ecological modelingâ€”from theory to practice and its implications.

This website serves as my portfolio. Here, you will find information about me, my work, and side projects and tutorials I create during my free time.

Feel free to reach out!
