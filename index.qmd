Hello, nice to meet you!

I'm a biologist and mathematician with skills in statistics, data science and programming.

Academically, I'm mostly interested in all aspects of ecological modelingâ€”from theory to practice, and its implications.

This website serves as my portfolio. Here, you will find information about me, my work, and side projects.

Feel free to reach out!
